.vimrc file and Ubuntu colour scheme for OS X terminal

## .vimrc

The .vimrc file uses Vundle for plugin management. For the `PluginInstall` and `BundleInstall`
commands to work, Vundle must be installed first.

Detailed instructions and examples can be found at https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim

The most important thing is to install Vundle.

`$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`

After that, open Vim and run `PluginInstall`
